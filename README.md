# Readme

Goal of the project:
    - Analyse a python script.
    - Notify the user when an import is not used.
    - Notify the user when a function is never called.
    - Notify the user when a refenced variable is either not defined or 'out of scope'. This doesn't give an error but sometimes leads to undesired behaviour. This is the primary function of the program.
    - Notify the user of inconsistent indentation.
    - Notify the user of usage of global variables without using 'global \<variable\>' in the function.

Things that are not going to be supported:
    - Checking for invalid variable names/function names/class names (invalid names will be skipped).
    - Classes inside of functions.
    - Classes inside of classes.

### General notes

12-07-2023
Maybe pretend the entire file (except the root) is a function, and handle the file as a function (aka get list of functions, imports, classes, variables), but handle it as a root case (the global keyword can be used in this function). Then analyse any subfunction the same way (but without root), and any class can be handled with its own handling function (which should only be slightly different). This way you can create a nested analysis, in which each object deeper has its own scope.
Also create warning codes so the user can suppress warnings that they don't want to see. (Be careful not to create a linter, those already exist.)
