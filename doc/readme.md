# Readme

Goal of the project:
    - Analyse a python script.
    - Notify the user when an import is not used.
    - Notify the user when a function is never called.
    - Notify the user when a refenced variable is either not defined or 'out of scope'. This doesn't give an error but sometimes leads to undesired behaviour. This is the primary function of the program.
    - Notify the user of inconsistent indentation.
